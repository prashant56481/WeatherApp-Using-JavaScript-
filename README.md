# WeatherApp-Using-JavaScript-
A Realtime Simple WebApp which shows current weather stats of your location using JavaScript.

Weather Stats is used from "Dark-sky.net" API(https://darksky.net/dev).Create your free account and generate your key.Change Lat and Long in API key with your Location(Lat,Long).

This API doesn't let you access data from LocalHost thus use a Proxy website(https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) and concatinate it before API key.

Icons are used from Skycons(https://darkskyapp.github.io/skycons/) and can be cloned from Github Easily(https://github.com/darkskyapp/skycons) and use "skycons.js"
